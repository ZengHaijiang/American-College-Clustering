# American-College-Clustering
We got a dataset on American college and university rankings containing information about offering an undergraduate program.
And Here is what we gonna do:
1. We scale the features.
2. We conduct a PCA and analysis of the first 4 components and draw some beautiful graphs.
3. We run kmeans cluster algorithm and use silhouette_score as well as the kmeans.inertia to determine # of cluster to use.
4. Repeat Step 3 and try to describe the clusters.
